# Ad Placement & Bidding System - Implementation Plan

*Strategic Planning Session - January 19, 2025*

## 🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Core Concept**: Gamified free-market ad positioning where businesses compete for visibility through transparent bidding, with no artificial "premium" tiers.

## 💰 PRICING & MARKET MECHANICS

### Bidding Rules
- **Base Entry**: $5/week minimum bid
- **Competition**: To get top position = Current Top Bid + $5
- **Market-Driven**: Pure supply & demand pricing
- **Weekly Cycles**: Billing resets every Monday

### Example Pricing Flow
```
Week 1: First advertiser pays $5 → Position #1
Week 2: Competitor pays $10 → Takes Position #1
Week 3: Original pays $15 → Reclaims Position #1
```

## 📐 LAYOUT & POSITIONING

### Ad-to-Listing Ratio: 1:4
- 5 tiles per row → 1 ad maximum (position 1)
- 8 tiles per row → 2 ads maximum (positions 1 & 5)  
- 10 tiles per row → 2 ads maximum (positions 1 & 5)

### No Premium Features
- All ads use same creation tools and appearance
- Only difference is positioning based on bid amount
- Pure free-market dynamics

## 🎮 GAMIFICATION ELEMENTS

### Competition Dashboard
- Current top position price display
- "Beat this bid" interface
- Weekly reset countdown
- Bidding history charts
- Position effectiveness analytics

### Real-Time Notifications
- Outbid alerts
- Position change notifications  
- Weekly billing summaries
- Market pulse updates

### Auto-Bidding Options
- Set maximum auto-bid limits
- Automatic $5 increment responses
- Budget protection controls

## 🗄️ DATABASE SCHEMA

### Core Table: ad_bids
```sql
CREATE TABLE ad_bids (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  listing_id UUID REFERENCES listings(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  weekly_bid_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  max_auto_bid DECIMAL(10,2),
  auto_renew BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  week_start DATE,
  current_position INTEGER, -- Dynamic calculation
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Position Logic
- Positions calculated dynamically by bid amount sorting
- No fixed "slots" - pure ranking system
- Highest bid = Position 1, second highest = Position 2, etc.

## ⚡ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Algorithm
```javascript
function calculatePositions(activeBids) {
  return activeBids
    .sort((a, b) => b.weekly_bid_amount - a.weekly_bid_amount)
    .map((bid, index) => ({
      ...bid,
      position: index + 1,
      tile_position: calculateTilePosition(index + 1)
    }));
}

function getToBeatPrice(currentTopBid) {
  return currentTopBid ? currentTopBid + 5 : 5;
}
```

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/ad-positions` - Current market state
- `POST /api/ad-bids` - Submit/update bid
- `GET /api/ad-bids/my-bids` - User's active bids
- `GET /api/ad-market-pulse` - Competition analytics

## 🎲 KEY DECISIONS MADE

3. **Billing**: Weekly cycles starting Mondays
4. **Market**: Pure free-market, no artificial premium tiers
5. **Competition**: Transparent "beat current bid" system
6. **Gamification**: Real-time dashboards and notifications

## 🚀 RESUMPTION POINT FOR TOMORROW

**Next Step**: Begin Phase A implementation
**Start With**: Database schema creation and basic bidding API

**Questions to Address Tomorrow**:
1. Auto-bidding limits and increment rules
2. Bidding frequency restrictions (daily vs unlimited)
3. Market data visibility (show competitor trends?)
4. Fallback behavior when no active bids
5. Admin controls for market oversight

## 📊 BUSINESS IMPACT PROJECTION

**Revenue Potential**:
- Conservative: 5 businesses × $10/week average = $200/month
