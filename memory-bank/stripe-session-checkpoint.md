**Location:** `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` lines 43-48
```javascript
.select('id, user_id, type, business_name')  // ← business_name doesn't exist!
```

**Impact:** Prevents all business ad payments from working

**Debug Logs Showed:**
```
🔍 CHECKOUT DEBUG - Found listing: null
🔍 CHECKOUT DEBUG - Listing error: {
  code: '42703',

## 💡 **UX IMPROVEMENT DISCOVERED:**

### **Dual-Button Confusion in Preview Step**

**Current Problematic Flow:**
```
Preview Step → [Publish Advertisement] OR [Continue to Placement] 
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ "Publish Advertisement" suggests free publishing
- ❌ Creates confusion about paid vs free options  
- ❌ No clear path for business ads (all should be paid)

**Recommended Solution:**
```
Preview Step → [Continue to Payment & Placement] (single clear path)
Payment Step → [Publish Ad - Standard ($5)] [Publish Ad - Premium ($X)]
```
