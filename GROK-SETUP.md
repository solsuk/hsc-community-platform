# Grok API Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup for Grok AI Integration

Your HSC chatbot now uses **Grok** (by xAI) instead of Anthropic Claude. Grok offers:
- ‚úÖ **Better pricing** ($0.30/M vs $15/M for input tokens)
- ‚úÖ **Free tier available** with usage quotas
- ‚úÖ **Real-time web access** (unlike Claude)
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI-compatible API** (easy integration)

## Step 1: Get Your Free Grok API Key

1. **Visit**: https://console.x.ai/
2. **Sign up** with your email (no credit card required for free tier)
3. **Get $25 in free credits** (as of 2024)
4. **Copy your API key** from the dashboard

## Step 2: Add API Key to Your Project

1. **Update your `.env.local` file**:
   ```bash
   # Replace the old Anthropic key with:
   XAI_API_KEY=your-actual-grok-api-key-here
   ```

2. **Remove the old Anthropic key line** (if it exists):
   ```bash
   # Delete this line:
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api...
   ```

## Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the chatbot**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "What is HSC?"}'
   ```

## Expected Response

You should see a response like:
```json
{
  "type": "ai_chat",
  "message": "Welcome to HSC (Hillsmere Shores Classifieds)! üèòÔ∏è\n\nHSC is your neighborhood's online classifieds board..."
}
```
